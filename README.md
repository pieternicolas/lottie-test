Guidelines to start the project:

1. Copy the `.env.example` files from each frontend and backend folders to a `.env` file
2. Change the contents when necessary. (e.g. change the mongo url in the backend repo to point at a database)
3. Install `pnpm` on your local
4. Run `pnpm install`
5. Run `pnpm run serve` to serve the built version of the app
